Spitch AI - User Manual
=======================

Welcome to Spitch AI! This guide will help you get the most out of your new assistant.

**A Note on Commands:** Spitch is designed to understand natural language. While the commands below are good examples, don't be afraid to try your own phrasing. If Spitch is unsure what you mean, it will ask for clarification. For best results, speak clearly and provide specific details.

## Important Note on Spotify

## Troubleshooting

*   **Command Not Understood?** If Spitch doesn't understand your command, try rephrasing it. For example, instead of "Buzz the song," try "Pause the song" or "Stop the music."
*   **Spotify Not Working?**
    1.  Ensure the Spotify app is open on your computer.
    2.  Make sure you are logged in and can play music from the app directly.
    3.  Remember that playback controls like pause/resume may require a Premium account.
